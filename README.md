It is available at https://oii-sdp-2016.github.io/how-to-learn-to-code

# I want to help

There are two ways to do so:

* Read it, use it, and raise issues [here](https://github.com/OII-SDP-2016/how-to-learn-to-code/issues), or
* help us writing.

If you want to help us writing, contact one of the [contributors of this repository](https://github.com/OII-SDP-2016/how-to-learn-to-code/graphs/contributors) if you want to become one. Don't be afraid if you're not technically inclined. Helping us to reformulate and correct text is very welcome and easy to do with the approach we're using. It's almost as easy as writing in Word.
