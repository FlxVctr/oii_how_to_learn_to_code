# How to learn to code

This is going to be a legacy project for [OII SDP 2016](http://sdp.oii.ox.ac.uk). It will contain a step-by-step guide with ressources relevant to scientific programming and data analysis.

## Learning Python

[Python](https://python.org) is a easy to learn programming language and quite effective for data analysis, that's why we are starting with Python.

1. Learn the syntax at [Codacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)
2. If you want to know more, take a look on the book [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html) for free

## Learn TDD

Test Driven Development, or TDD, is a great approach to development, that will save you hours of debuging. 

1. Start with [Beginning Test-Driven Development in Python](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/beginning-test-driven-development-in-python--net-30137)
2. If you want t go deeper in tests, take a look in this early version of [Test-Driven Development with Python](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/index.html) for free
