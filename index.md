# How to learn to code

This is going to be a legacy project for [OII SDP 2016](http://sdp.oii.ox.ac.uk). It will contain a step-by-step guide with ressources relevant to scientific programming and data analysis.

## 1. Learning Python

[Python](https://python.org) is a easy to learn programming language and quite effective for data analysis, that's why we are starting with Python.

**Complete the course at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python). If you're lucky, this will take you one rainy weekend. If you're unlucky, the sun will come out. Nobody said it's going to be easy ;)**

## 2. Installing Python on your computer

* First it is important to get used to the command line [here](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line), if you aren't already.
* Then it is time to install Python. There are tons of ways to do it but one of the easiest is to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda) â€” a package that includes a lot of useful tools for data analysis. Go to their [download page, and choose the **Python 3.5** distribution for your operational system](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). For convenience use the graphical installer, if available.
* Install it using their installer and following their install instructions.
* Now open a command line application (e.g. the preinstalled Terminal on Mac OS X) and type `which python`. Hit Enter. You should get an output along the lines of this:

```
$ which python
/Users/YOURUSERNAME/anaconda/bin/python
```

* If you enter `python` (hitting Enter will be omitted from now on ;) ) you should see a Python shell as you had it in the Codecademy course.
* Try things out you've learned in the course.
* When you're finished hit <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd>. You will see the command line again.

## 3. Get a good text editor

## 4. Write your first script

## What next?

Here are a few things you could find useful on your further journey:

### Python Resources

* **[The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/)**: A good thing to read through over time to understand how to become a decent Python programmer.
* [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/thinkpython.html)

### Learn TDD

Test Driven Development, or TDD, is a great approach to development, that will save you hours of debuging.

1. Start with [Beginning Test-Driven Development in Python](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/beginning-test-driven-development-in-python--net-30137)
2. If you want t go deeper in tests, take a look in this early version of [Test-Driven Development with Python](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000754/index.html) for free
